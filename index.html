      <h2>Cool Stuff</h2>

      <h3>Websites</h3>

      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://bonzibuddy.tk/" target="_blank">https://bonzibuddy.tk/</a> - A tribute to Bonzibuddy</li>
        <li><a href="https://theuselessweb.com/" target="_blank">https://theuselessweb.com/</a> - A random website that takes you to other interesting websites</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Video Games</h3>

      <p><strong>In regards to my <span class="yellow">favorite</span> game, my number one is split between two games. <a href="https://minecraft.net" target="_blank">Minecraft</a> and <a href="https://rimworldgame.com/" target="_blank">Rimworld</a>!</strong></p> 

      <div class="right">
        <img class="center" src="/media/screenshotMinecraftModded.png" alt="There is a copper-spruce pagoda in the background with a bunch of machinery in the foreground along with a Hisuian Typhlosion, a purple badger looking creature with purple flames">
        <p class="center grey">A personal screenshot from a modded Minecraft server that I hosted</p>
      </div>

      <p>In <a href="https://minecraft.net" target="_blank"><strong>Minecraft</strong></a>, a thing that I often enjoy finding myself doing is building contraptions of <span class="yellow">automation</span> both in base game as well as in <span class="purple">modded</span> play. Much of said modded play consists of playing on expansive <span class="cyan">technology</span> related modpacks that ill get lost in for long periods of time</p>
      
            <p>For <a href="https://rimworldgame.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Rimworld</strong></a> a thing that I enjoy about the game is playing out <span class="green">scenarios</span>. Be it operating a containment facility of scientists researching and delving into the nature of <span class="yellow">lovecraftian horrors</span> or running a gang of bandits who are out to corner the organ market through the use of a variety of <span class="red">war crimes</span>! In addition to all this, the rather extensive <span class="purple">modding</span> platform that the game has which further expands the possibilities within this game</p>

      <div class="right">

      <h3>Music</h3>

      <p>Honestly, I enjoy a <span class="green">wide variety</span> of music with very few specific genres that I dislike, but if I were to make a few selections of some things I always come back to, I'd say <span class="yellow">Electronic</span> and <span class="purple">Metal</span>.

        <p class="center grey">An old screenshot of the website before the revamp circa 2024</p>
      </div>

      <p>Originally hosted on <a href="https://replit.com" target="_blank">Replit</a>, this was just a little website that I created as a small gag a few years back to share rick rolls and funny videos under a personal website. I often would forget of the existence of the site, only occasionally getting DMs about being rick rolled because someone had found a ricked link to my site. However, on November 21st of 2024, I would become reinvigorated into working on my site after being made aware of a recently growing "Indie Web". To keep it short, it is basically a little movement to go against the corporate web and to relive old times where the world wide web was much more independent and unique. The popular sites of today are so corporatized and all similar looking. Think Twitter, Reddit, and Youtube versus those retro style websites, blogs, and forums from the early days of the internet</p>
